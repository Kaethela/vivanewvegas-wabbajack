## BEFORE YOU BEGIN PLAYING

* On the left panel is a mod entitled **lStewieAI's Tweaks** - this is a file loaded with options that change how the game plays and crucial engine level fixes. If you are happy with how the game plays you won't need to touch anything in this mod. Otherwise, you can look through the ini in this mod and enable or disable tweaks and quality of life changes as you see fit.
* This modlist uses JSawyer Ultimate Edition to provide a more challenging but fair gameplay. This mod can be disabled.

## KNOWN ISSUES

* Loot Menu doesn't work during the character generation quest while you're still in Doc Mitchell's house. This is intended.
